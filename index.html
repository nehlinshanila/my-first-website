                    <h4 class="titleabout"> ABOUT</h4>

                    <p class="about">I am a creative, ambitious and dedicated individual with knowledge in designing,
                        graphics and digital art. I am curently pursuing bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering
                        from North South University and have hopes of becoming a Front-end Developer in the future
                        where I can merge my artistic knowledge with logics and code to formulate something meaningful.
                        I have also been heavily involved in social work throughout my school life and am continuing
                        similar work through club activities in my university. </p>
